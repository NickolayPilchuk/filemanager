So, that was all for today. Now i just want to say that, as i writed in my community tab, i left Mariupol for study. I did it because i want to study in a good university. There are 4 universities in Mariupol, but none of them is as good as in big russian cities. Anyway, i will visit Mariupol sometimes, and I also have friends in Mariupol who can record for me and for you, so stay tuned.And if you want see my videos more often you can send me a donation by the link in the description. Have a nice day.
